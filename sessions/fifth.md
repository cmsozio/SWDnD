https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/a/a2/Maridun_NEGAS.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20061111104517

Normal combat against two enemy ships to make it easier this time. Griff and Matt can be in the cockpit rolling for something, while Andrew, Adam, and Parker can be in manning the turrets. Two rebel ships can be attacking them. 120 hp each on the rebel ships and can do 10 damage each strike. They have 100 hp and can do 15 damage each strike. AC for rebels are 13 and for them its 15. Griff and matt can roll for accuracy with advantage.if higher than 13 then they can hit their targets. 

Once they come close to killing the last one or close to death the droid battleship will jump out of hyperspace in front of them and send the vulture droids out at them. Then they cant do anything and the droids will take them into the capital ship to see the dathomirian. he is yellow, and darth maul will come over a hologram and ask for him to bring blathers to him. Qira will be in the background. end by having them being taken to cells.
