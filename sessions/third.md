### Introduction
Dashade is angry and willing to attack anything in sight. Will try to attack Wabi first unless Djazar comes out and kills him. Once they get over the introductions the Death Trooper will talk about why he needs the rhydonium fuel and Blathers will explain why he needs it.

### Death Trooper Explanation
Death Trooper explains he wants to kill the hidden Empire Commander who stole him from his family. Commander Merdon Ruth. Explains that he is located on the planet of [Maridun](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun). 

### Blathers Explanation
Blathers explains that he is working for Roth the Hutt and was told to steal the rydonium fuel from Bantu the Hutt's pirates. They need to deliver the rhydonium back to him.

Roth the Hutt is a Hutt that despises his cousin Bantu the Hutt and has helped the rebel alliance secretly with weapons and fuel throughout the galactic war.

### Roth the Hutt Route
Roth's Palace is located outside of the Mos Eisley Spaceport. They pull up to the back of the palace. You can hear the loud music from outside, laughter, and yelling. Two [Gamorrean Guards](https://sw5e.com/rules/snv/monsters/Gamorrean%20Guard) sit outside and ask who they are and what they are doing.

Blathers explains he is here to drop off the shipment of rhydonium fuel to Roth the Hutt. The guards escort them through the palace to Roth the Hutt. Throughout the palace they can see smugglers, bounty hunters, and maraduars talking, playing Sabacc and Dejarik, trading and making deals.

Before the guards take the players to trading section of the palace to trade and look at equipment.

After the guards take them up to Roth the Hutt to discuss the rhydonium fuel. Once they arrive to the throne room Roth the Hutt welcomes in Blathers and says "your mother would be proud." then asks who his associates are. One of his servants tells him that Bantu the Hutt has caught word that a group of armed men hired by Roth stole his rhydonium and killed his Dashadian slave. Roth turns to Blathers "I told you he was not supposed to find out about your mission." Blathers explains that a band of Tuskens attacked the pirates first so they had to go in and take it from them. Roth knows that Blathers is lying and orders the guards to attack.

Fighting commences. If it begins to not turn out so well Blathers will suggest to escape. Otherwise they can take Roth the Hutt's money (50,000 credits).

Then Blathers explains that they need to buy a ship and leave this planet quickly.

### Death Trooper Route
Death Trooper (DT-214) explains they need to head back to the bunker to use the Commander Lark Tarkins ST-341 [Delta-class T-3c shuttle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/91/9a/0a919a265b74c91ecefd3032ae1d1f19.jpg) to get to the planet of Maridun secretly. They travel back to the bunker, but while they do that in the middle of the night they are attacked by a group of pirates on speeders. They are pirates from Bantu the Hutt. 6 pirates attack the yacht. 

Once the battle is over they get back to the bunker there are 4 stormtroopers there waiting for them. Then battle comenses again.

They eventually load up the rhydonium fuel and head out. Once they get there they have to communicate that they are there to drop off equipment to the base to the communications tower. There are 3 star destroyers flying above the planet

When they land the Death Trooper explains that there will be a deck commanding officer and two stormtroopers coming onto the ship and that they had to hide somehow. 

### Coaxium Route
They need to buy a ship in order to get off the planet.

They will fly to the planet of Savareen and talk to the people there about getting the coaxium refined. They are ambushed by two stormtroopers and an AT-ST. Use the ion grenades to disable the AT-ST.
