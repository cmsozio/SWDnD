## Table of Contents

### Overview
1. Recap of last week
2. Go back to the Bunker to investigate and steal the Delta-class T-3c shuttle.
2. Decide what they are going to do.
    - Go to Savareen to refine the coaxium (10 capsules, 10,000 credits each) that they will find on the ship.
    - Go to Maridun (Near Yavin) to kill the mysterious commander for DT-214. (Go against)
3. Fly to the destined planet/area.
4. Do the activity.

### Go back to the Bunker
- Have DT-214 mention his plane that he has, the ST-341 [Delta-class T-3c shuttle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/91/9a/0a919a265b74c91ecefd3032ae1d1f19.jpg). 
- Most likely will fly in the back where the ship is, DT will hop out first and go open the bunker door and motion for them to enter. 
- Inside the Bunker there is only a bag with 10 thermal detonaters located right next to Commander Lark Tarkin's body. 
- Blathers will be locked outside the door closing behind DT. 
- Once all inside DT will arm the detonators and aim his weapon at all of them threatening them if they move. 
- The door will then open with Blathers walking in and stabbing right through DT with his electoripper staff. They cant see Blathers at first though.
- Blathers will say he knows how to disarm the detonators.
- Let them talk and look for stuff.
- Crack in the middle of the wall. If they hold their hand over the middle of the crack there will be some message "error noise" and show a red hand. Hopefully they get it to where they drag Lark Tarkins body over to it.
- Inside there is a shelf with 5 imperial silver thingys (5000 credits) and a transmission that the majority of the fleet is leaving Maridun.

### Savareen
- When flying in they will get a message over the ship "What is your business coming here?" allow them to answer.
- Have them fly in pay 2,000 credits to refine the coaxium (10 capsules, 10,000 credits each).
- Unload the coaxium and connect it to the refiners
- While they do this a rebel ship comes flying down and if they used the ST-341 then the rebel will question them why they are there and what they are doing with the coaxium. 
- If they are hostile he wont buy the coaxium off of them, but if not he will.
- Will not mention where Leia is and is flying a U-wing. Refining 20 capsules of coaxium.
- End it on their ship deciding where to go. 

### Maridun

5 imperial silver thingys (5000 credits), on Lark's body there is another transmission.
