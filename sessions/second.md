[Galaxy](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/9f/6c/3e9f6c3cee7acee07c84fc9cf57af011.png)

Two Choices:
1. Begin the adventure of tracking down one of the ex-Empire commanders.
2. Attack the pirates to unlock Andrew.

### Start 

The decision to go to Blathers first for the credits or go to the bunker to investigate. 

### Blathers
- Talk about not knowing anything about Princess Leia just leaving. Thought they wouldnt be able to escort her.
- Pay out the credits (5000 cr.)
- Talk about some more work about taking out some pirates. 
- If they choose not to then say to come back for work anytime. 

- These pirates are stopping transports of [rhydonium canisters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel) from one of the traders in the city.

### Bunker
- They get there and then Commander Larkin Tarkin asks who they are and what they are doing. The Death Trooper comes out and assasinates the Commander. Then explains that he did not like the empire after all, and he had been wanting a way to escape for a while. 
- Asks if they want to help him to track down the commander who took him away from his family and kill him.
- But needs to attack the pirates for [rhydorium canisters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel).

### Pirates
- A group of pirates standing around a smaller [yacht](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office/office-chairs/eames-executive-chair/2055.html?lang=en_US#lang=en_US&start=1) loading up [rhydonium canisters](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel) onto speeders.
- They can sneak around to the back of the yacht but one of them has to roll a 15 or higher in Stealth (Dex.)
- If they go around back they can try a deception roll of natural 20 and be able to get in safely. Otherwise get in a battle with two troopers. Then 3 on the inside.
- If they decide to attack the front guys then they have to fight off 4 pirates. Then again 3 on the inside.

### Inside Yacht
- Crates lying around filled with blaster rifles (1d8 energy, 11 lbs., Ammunition(range 100/400))
- One seems to be in a cooling box. It has 2 unrefined [coaxium](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coaxium) capsules in it. [Savareen](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Savareen) is below Christophsis and above Nelvaan. Can take it to Savareen to get it refined and sell it or use it.
- Deathtrooper comes walking through the door that they came in and asks why they are there. DT-214 is his name. 
- check the door and one person is in cryosleep. when they open it smoke puffs up blocking the window in the door and thats the session.
