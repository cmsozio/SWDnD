- offers them credits to help the troopers
- if they accept takes them to hidden bunker just outside the city

### Blathers Route
- Get stopped in the street and asked what they are doing by the two ex-Empire Stormtroopers. Nothing should come of this, just dialogue to make players suspenseful. 
- Once they arrive to his residency he tells them to stay in the common area and goes and checks each room. 
- Then explains the job of escorting Princess Leia (with the locations) to the destroyed base of [Anchorhead](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anchorhead_Base)
- If they accept then Princess Leia walks out with two rebel guards. (Commander Roc Tritus and Authin Eather)
- Small dialogue of thanks, will tell players what they are protecting (stolen locations of ex-Empire commanders), and tells Commander Roc to escort the players to the [speeders](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike/Legends) and that she will be there shortly.
- Then dialogue about being aware for ex-Empire in the area, and then head out.

### ex-Empire Route
- Inside the broken bunker lies Commander Lark Tarkin, with two more stormtroopers and a death trooper. 
- Commander Lark Tarkin explains to them what the job is and shows them the credits they will earn upon arrival of the information they possess. 
- If they accept Commader Lark Tarkin points to the stormtroopers (4) to load up, as well as the death trooper who bends down to pick up a bag. It seems to be heavy.
- They go to the [speeders](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike/Legends) and head out.

### Speeder Encounter
- If players went ex-Empire Route then they only see the 3 speeders going into the base.
- If players went Blathers Route then they have a choice of attacking in the desert or continue in to the base.

- If they continue on to the base then have the ex-Empire troopers drive up next to them and begin to attack but slow down because of it allowing the players to drive past to the base.

- If they decide to fight, then let [fighting](#fight-in-the-desert) commense.
- After the fighting Princess Leia will say thanks, and hope that their paths cross again. 
- Then they can check the bodies for the record of the mission and location of Commander Lark Tarkin and where he is hiding and end the session with the them hearing the [blast off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXYrHB86Kg0) of the Rebels.

### Fight in the Desert
- All on [74-Z Speeder Bikes](https://sw5e.com/rules/snv/monsters/74-Z%20Speeder%20Bike).
- Roll for Initiative (d20)
- Check against AC (Armor class) to see if blast hits or not. Then start the damage.

### Fight in the Hangar
- [Troopers](https://sw5e.com/rules/snv/monsters/Trooper)
- [Death Trooper](https://sw5e.com/rules/snv/monsters/Death%20Trooper) only blaster rifle shots.
- Princess Leia and the two other Rebels run into the ship and [blast off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXYrHB86Kg0). 

- If from Blathers then fight the stormtroopers and have Death Trooper leave on speeder back to the bunker. Then they can find a record of the mission they are on and describing Commander Lark Tarkin and where he is hiding and end the session.

- If from ex-Empire see the Rebels blast off and return back to the bunker to fight.
- Once they arrive to the bunker Commander Lark Tarkin gets angry and orders the stormtroopers to attack them for failing. Death Trooper jumps back behind debris. Attacking commences, once stormtroopers are dead the Death Trooper comes up and assasinates Commander Lark Tarkin. If the players attack the Death Trooper then let the fighting continue. 
- If they talk to the Death Trooper he will explain that he liked the downfall of the Empire and that he no longer saw it profitable to work under Commander Lark Tarkin so he took matters into his own hands. He will then only say his name of DT-214 and end the session.
