### 1. Choose a Species
Choose the species you would like to play as. A list of species is contained [here](/species.md). With these species there are multiple different special traits to keep in mind when creating your character, just like any normal D&D game.

### 2. Choose a Class
Choose a class you would like to have for your character. A list of classes is contained [here](/classes.md). We will decide what level we want to start out as, so do not worry too much about that. 

### 3. Determine Ability Scores
Determine your ability scores for the following abilities: <b>Strength</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>, <b>Constitution</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, <b>Wisdom</b>, <b>Charisma</b>. There are two ways of determining your characters ability scores.
1. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times.
2. Or use the following scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1 | -5 |
| 2-3 | -4 |
| 4-5 | -3 |
| 6-7 | -2 |
| 8-9 | -1 |
| 10-11 | +0 |
| 12-13 | +1 |
| 14-15 | +2 |
| 16-17 | +3 |
| 18-19 | +4 |
| 20-21 | +5 |
| 22-23 | +6 |
| 24-25 | +7 |
| 26-27 | +8 |
| 28-29 | +9 |
| 30 | +10 |

### 4. Describe Your Character
You know the drill.

### 5. Choose Equipment
Your class and background will determine your character's starting equipment (weapons, armor, and adventuring gear). 

#### <b>Armor Class</b>
Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals 10 + his or her dexterity modifier. 

#### <b>Weapons</b>
When you make an attack with a wepon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus and the appropriate ability modifier. 
- For attacks with <b>melee</b> weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. 
- For attacks with <b>ranged</b> weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. 

### 6. Come Together
Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll.
