3. <b>Roll Initiative.</b> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.
4. <b>Take Turns.</b> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
5. <b>Begin the Next Round.</b> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.
